Hello Respected Reviewer!
## NOTE: I was not able to figure out how to display raw data on user demand 

Below are some things i want to mention about the project

1. I have restructured the program a little bit as i was having issues running the python file from VS code

2. I have used below resources to make the project 
   Pandas - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9WGC0SLPVs&t=903s, https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp

3. For creating the .exe file ive used this website:
